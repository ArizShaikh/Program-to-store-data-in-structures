# Program-to-store-data-in-structures

Aim : Program to create structures, store student info and display

Description : 
        Structure is a user defined data type in c which allows us to compare data of different types together. 
        Structure helps to construct a complex data type which is more meaningful. 
        It is somewhat similar to an array.
        Here we create s structure which stores information of students such as name,prn etc
